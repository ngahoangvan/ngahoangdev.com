Hello everyone, it’s me again. Today is the first day of the Year of the Horse 2026, according to Eastern tradition. I wish you a new year full of health and energy for the challenges and opportunities ahead.

I'm back after a long time. I've been busy with work and life, and I've been away from my blog for a while. I'm sorry for that. Looking back at 2025, it was a year of growth but also many distractions. I realized how much I missed sharing my technical journey and connecting with all of you.

I will comeback strongly in this 2026 year. My plan is to share one to two topics per month. I'll be focusing more on Deep Dives into Kubernetes, Cloud Infrastructure (especially AWS), and how we can integrate AI into our daily workflows.

Also, I am planning to update this site to provide a personal chatbot. This isn't just about adding a feature; I want to build a companion that can help you navigate the content on this blog more effectively, answering your technical questions based on the articles I've written. It's a project I've been thinking about for a while, and 2026 feels like the perfect time to make it happen.

Hope everyone will have a great year and look forward to interesting things! Let's make this Year of the Horse a productive and exciting one together.
